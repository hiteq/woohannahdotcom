**Woo Hannah:** _**Appearances**_

**March 9-March 25, 2023**

South Korean artist Woo Hannah presents her latest collection of fabric sculptures and installations at Frieze No. 9 Cork Street. Titled _Appearances_, the exhibition runs from March 9 to March 25 and features works created between 2020 and 2023. It explores femininity and challenges conventional ways of objectifying and dissecting certain subjects. This marks Woo's first solo exhibition outside of South Korea.

Represented by G Gallery in Seoul, South Korea, Woo is known for using fabric to create fantastical and mythical worlds in visual forms such as drawing, sculpture, and installation. Her use of fabric, a material conventionally associated with femininity and manual labor, subverts the traditional grandeur of sculpture and offers a new perspective on the medium: passivity and flexibility. Fabric cannot be completely broken or destroyed, and if damaged, it can be repaired. Her subversive attitude towards the masculinity represented by sculptures is particularly evident in the way her installations suspend the fabric in midair, allowing it to sag. The fabric, the sculpture, is unable to resist the effects of gravity and dangles helplessly instead, as if it has been hanged.

In _Appearances_, Woo's fabric sculptures challenge traditional representations of male and female anatomy by blurring the lines between the two. With a playful and lighthearted touch, she presents sexual anatomy as equal subjects of humor, devoid of any sense of difference or discrimination. Her works embody both wit and cuteness, while also exploring the macabre and monstrous. They bring a fresh and subversive perspective to the medium, breaking away from its typical heaviness and rigidity.

After discovering that one of her kidneys had shrunk abnormally in 2019, Woo began a journey of self-exploration through the creation of a fabric bag that mimicked the shape of various organs, expressing feelings of loss and possessiveness. The organs range from the uterus to the hippocampus and even blood vessels.

In the _Bag with You – Take Your Shape_ series, part of the _Sculpture Impulse_ exhibition at the Buk-Seoul Museum of Art in 2022, Woo invited the audience to participate by donning and embodying the shapes of the organs of various animals, including humans. Viewers were able to observe their own transformation through mirrors and explore the relationships between different species.

Her work in _Appearances_ has since expanded to include organs of various living creatures and mythical beings, such as dragons, showcasing her boundless imagination and unique perspective. This development stems from Woo's desire to avoid the frustration and guilt that comes with being a top predator, as humans were born. By embracing an egalitarian view of all life on Earth, she aims to foster horizontal relationships.

On the opening day of the exhibition, Woo will be joined by Chus Martinez, the director of the Art Institute at the FHNW Academy of Art and Design in Basel, for a conversation about the exhibition and key themes in the artist's practice at 4 p.m.
