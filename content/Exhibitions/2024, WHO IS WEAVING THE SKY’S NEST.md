On View in Singapore at Yeo Workshop [@yeoworkshop](https://www.instagram.com/yeoworkshop/) as a part of their recent group exhibition, 《Who is Weaving the Sky Net?》 from 2 November 2024 - 5 January 2025.

Curated by New York-based Vietnamese curator Do Tuong Linh [@dotuonglinh](https://www.instagram.com/dotuonglinh/), the exhibition spotlights eight artists who have long explored textiles as metaphors for the universe’s construction.

  

Woo Hannah creates fabric sculptures that originate from the shapes of human and animal organs and systems, compensating for the notion of loss and satisfying the desire for possession. After discovering that one of her kidneys had shrunk abnormally in 2019, Woo began a journey of self-exploration through the creation of a fabric bag that mimicked the shape of various organs, to express such feelings of loss and possessiveness. It leads to a preoccupation with what one does not have, what one cannot have, and extends to an understanding of what is not one's own, but merely different from oneself.

  

The works in Who is Weaving the Sky Net? are part of her subsequent Bag with you series, which evolves beyond human organs to an imagination of a being that can transcend its current fixed body and identity by attaching and carrying gills, beaks, and tails that humans do not have. By using the organs of other beings, the artist seeks to transcend the current concept of a finite and fixed body, and to create a horizontal relationship with other beings that transcends the existing dichotomous boundaries that separate humans from all.
