The installation works were created for the Frieze Artist Award Frieze, supported by Bulgari.

  

Woo's winning commission, titled The Great Ballroom (2023), is a large-scale installation that continues her series Milk and Honey  
(2023-ongoing). It serves as a celebratory avenue for vitality and liberation. The installation's draped fabrics accentuate the flexible nature of the fabric and bring to mind the shape of women's breasts.

  
It is reminiscent of hanging curtains in a ballroom, or a bat spreading its wings in mid-air. Woo's installation embraces the inevitability of decay and rejects the conventional standard of beauty imposed on women by conceptualizing the process of ageing and the dynamic bodily transformation. Each fabric piece represents a different stage of a woman's body during breastfeeding - from the swelling of breasts in preparation, to the restful period when the milk subsides.
